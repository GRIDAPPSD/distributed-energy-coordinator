# Distributed Energy Coordinator Application

This repository contains the distributed energy coordinator application for over-voltage mitigation in power distribution systems. The application presents a fairness-based energy coordination strategy enabling customers to share the responsibility of voltage regulation in distribution systems. The focus of this README is not on the application itself, but rather how to configure/run it as a user.


## Prerequisites

The proposed application is developed in Python and it requires the following packages for formulating and solving the optimization problem

1.  cvxpy
2.  networkx
3.  tabulate

All these packages can be installed using pip.
